def unique_kmers(genome, k):

    This function takes in a string representing the genome of an
    organism (or section of a genome) and an integer value k. It 
    returns a list of all the unique substrings of length k
    (often called k-mers) contained in that genome.

    This function accepts a string representing a genome
    and an integer k. It returns a dictionary which maps
    each occurring k-mer to the number of times that k-mer
    occurs within the genome.

    Note that it uses the above function, and so you 
    must consider that functions complexity in determining
    this functions complexity.
