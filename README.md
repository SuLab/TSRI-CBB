# Scripps Research CBB (CA and FL)
This is the Github repository for the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) community, and affiliated [core track for graduate students](https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/doctoral-program/customizable-curriculum/stbio400-440.html), at Scripps Research with the intention of providing TSRI and the larger San Diego bioinformatics community a collaborative network and relevant events. We serve ~300 researchers and enthusiasts.

Below is a brief description of each folder in this repository, and how it serves as a resource. 

## CBB Metadata
This is an overview of current topics of interest for CBB, based on introductory information in our metadata Google spreadsheet that CBB members population voluntarily (about ~30% contribute rate).

## Code Topics 
These are files between the Scripps Research Institute Specialized Code Topics in R or Python and Scripps Institution of Oceanography [R-Users group](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/R-Users-Presentations).

## Research in Progress
These are presentations for lab meeting-like seminars that occur monthly on all topics bioinformatics. Previous speakers can be contacted directly for a recording of their seminar.

## Workshops
These are focused, one-off workshops. Some of which have been in collaboration with [TEB Labs](https://github.com/Tebs-Lab).
