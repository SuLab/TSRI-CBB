# Scripps Research CBB (CA and FL)
This is the Github repository for the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) community at Scripps Research, affiliated with the [core track for graduate students](https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/doctoral-program/customizable-curriculum/stbio400-440.html), with the intention of providing TSRI and the larger San Diego bioinformatics community a collaborative network and relevant events. We serve ~300 researchers and enthusiasts.
<br><br>
*Our Mission:* We are four postdoctoral scholars across disciplines (2019 to present: Seminar Co-Coordinator [Dr Jerry Zak](https://github.com/trebbiano) and Programming Coordinator [Dr Sabah Ul-Hasan](https://github.com/sabahzero), 2020 to present: Platform Developer [Dr. Daniel Montiel Garcia](https://github.com/viperdb) and Seminar Co-Coordinator [Dr Haissi Cui](https://github.com/Haissi)) working together to (i) provide relevant seminars and workshops catered to community needs, (ii) host code reviews and discussions, and (iii) supply a platform both on- and off- line for Scripps Research employees and affiliates to connect with one another surrounding all topics CBB. We are an open, inclusive organization that adheres to [FAIR practices](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Learn and explore more via [our website](http://viperdb.scripps.edu/cbb/#home). All suggestions, questions, and comments are welcome at sulhasan[at]scripps.edu.
<br><br>
*Roles:* If any of the following leadership roles appeal to you, and/or if there is another you can devise, feel free to contact us.
- Career Events: Dr. Cui
- Code Topics and Workshops: Dr. Cui and Dr. Montiel Garcia 
- Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessbility: Everyone, including members 
- Github Updates: Dr. Ul-Hasan
- Monthly Seminars: Dr. Cui and Dr. Zak
- Quarterly Newsletters: Dr. Ul-Hasan
- Recruitment and Circulation: Dr. Ul-Hasan
- Website: Dr. Montiel Garcia and Dr. Ul-Hasan

*Relevant Resources*<br>
- Bi-annual [Applied Bioinformatics course](https://github.com/SuLab/Applied-Bioinformatics) (for previous recordings, contact the [Graduate Office](https://education.scripps.edu/about/contact/))
- Data visualization [workshops and resources](https://sabahzero.github.io/dataviz/workshops)
<br>

Below is a brief description of each folder in this repository, and how it serves as a resource. 

## [CBB Metadata](https://github.com/SuLab/TSRI-CBB/tree/main/CBB-Metadata) (click title to re-direct)
This is an overview of current topics of interest for CBB, based on introductory information in our metadata Google spreadsheet that CBB members population voluntarily (about ~30% contribute rate). Access to the active Google spreadsheet requires being part of the listserv (contact sulhasan[at]scripps.edu).

## [Monthly Seminars](https://github.com/SuLab/TSRI-CBB/tree/main/Seminars-Monthly) 
Also referred to as 'Research in Progress', these are presentations for lab meeting-like seminars that occur about once a month on all topics bioinformatics. Previous speakers can be contacted directly for a recording of their seminar. We are intentional in our speaker selection being representative across demographics, career stages, and topics.=

## [Coding Workshops and General Discussions](https://github.com/SuLab/TSRI-CBB/tree/main/Coding-WorkshopsEtc) 
These are focused coding (R and/or Python) workshops and events. Some have occurred as bi-weekly events, one-offs, or in collaboration with [TEB Labs](https://github.com/Tebs-Lab). We additionally link to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography [R-Users group](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/R-Users-Presentations) as another resource.
