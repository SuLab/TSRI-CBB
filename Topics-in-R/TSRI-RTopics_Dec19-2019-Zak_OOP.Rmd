Base R data structures
```{r}

# R is mosntly: Lists, vectors, matrices, and data frames
# But data we work with is actually more complex
# Disconnect between the tools bioinformaticians use vs the default software

# How to bridge the two? Hadley Wickham's Advanced R ==> Functional OOP (R) vs Encapsulated OOP (Python)
# Focus on functions is good because it aligns with our interests as biologists (in contrast to developers)
# Methods: Functions that are specific for an object type
# https://adv-r.hadley.nz/ 
# Base types found in Section 12.3
  
# Predecessor of R was S, with no support for objects
# Many of the original base functions run in C, and you can't find the source code
# Example
print
# function (x, ...) 
# UseMethod("print")
# <bytecode: 0x7fe341fac4b0>
# <environment: namespace:base>

# Package to identify which are base functions and which are not
install.packages("sloop")
library(sloop)
packageVersion("sloop") # v1.0.1

# Non-base R
# 1st - S3 you need to be disciplined here, since it will let you do things that shouldn't work
# 2nd - S4 (more unified and rigorous): what most applied bioinformaticians work with every day (ie RNASeq) 
# 3rd - R6 (built upon previous, etc)

# Example
lettervector <- c("a", "b", "c")
class(lettervector) # character
sloop::otype(lettervector) # not S3, S4, or R6 -- it's a hard-coded function written in C

# S3 example
numbervector <- c(1,2,3)
df <- data.frame(lettervector, numbervector)
sloop::otype(df) # S3; meaning dataframes were introduced with this version
sloop::otype(data.frame()) # Also S3

# Advantages of why to understand OOP 
# When we know what object type we're working with, then 
# We can query it manually to further see what component belong to what
# 1) This allows us to 'see' what is happening with that data (which isn't always possible with base R)
# 2) And then we can add things to the objects directly (with annotations)
# Can we do the revese where we an see the breakdown of all base, S3, S4, and R6 in a package?
